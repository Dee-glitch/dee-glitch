Hi, I'm Deedee!
I'm a software developer who speaks both human and computer languages. I love clean code, clever conversations, and books that keep me up past bedtime.

When Iâ€™m not building frontends, Iâ€™m usually juggling DIY projects, biking in the rain, or getting lost on long hikes.

    ðŸ”­ Frontend developer by trade, curious by nature
    
    ðŸ•¹ Always learning, always tinkering
    
    ðŸŒ± Open to projects that promote green coding and sustainability
    
    ðŸ’¬ Happy to chat about diversity, inclusion, and making tech a better place for everyone

Letâ€™s connect, collaborate, or just share some book recommendations.
